/** Description:
 * We will be given two sequences of integers, representing roses and lilies. We need to start making
 * wreaths knowing that one wreath needs 15 flowers. Our goal is to make at least 5 flower wreaths.
 * We will start crafting from the last lilies and the first roses. If the sum of their values is
 * equal to 15 â€“ create one wreath and remove them. If the sum is bigger than 15, just decrease the
 * value of the lilies by 2. If the sum is less than 15 we have to store them for later and remove them.
 * We need to stop combining when we have no more roses or lilies. In the end, if we have any stored
 * flowers we should make as many wreaths as we can with them.
