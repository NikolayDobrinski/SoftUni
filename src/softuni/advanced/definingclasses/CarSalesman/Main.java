/**Description:
 * We have to define two classes Car and Engine. A Car has a model, engine, weight and color. An Engine has model,
 * power, displacement and efficiency. A Car's weight and color and its Engine's displacements and efficiency are optional.
 * On the first line, we will read a number N which will specify how many lines of engines we will receive,
 * on each of the next N lines we will receive information about an Engine. After the lines with engines,
 * on the next line we will receive a number M â€“ specifying the number of Cars that will follow,
 * on each of the next M lines the information about a Car will follow in the following format
 * "<Model> <Engine> <Weight> <Color>", where the engine in the format will be the model of an existing Engine.
 * When creating the object for a Car, we should keep a reference to the real engine in it, instead of just the
 * engines model, note that the optional properties might be missing from the formats.
 * Our task is to print each car (in the order you received them) and its information in the format defined bellow.
 * If any of the optional fields has not been given we have to print "n/a".
